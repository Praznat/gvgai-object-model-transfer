LaunchObjectModeler.java contains the main function, the accuracy experiment, the exploration experiment, and various other tests. Player.java, ObjectInstance.java, ObjectClassModel.java, and RichMemoryManager.java contain the bulk of the code for interfacing with and collecting data from GVG-AI game episodes. Most of the transfer learning methods are in Transfer.java and EnsembleClassModel.java.
